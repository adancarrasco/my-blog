In 2017 I gave a talk about Web Technology Trends in Mexico, back then I was not using any trendy technologies in my current job. What I did to prepare my talk was to use Google Trends, this tool allowed me to compare some of the trendy technologies back then. Since I was working as a Web Developer, mainly focused on the Front End I did research about the most popular frameworks. To my surprise those Frameworks hasn't changed as of now. The frameworks I picked were: Angular, VueJS and ReactJS.

First, I started by looking at the getting started in each of their Websites. I noted some differeces in the way they worked. Angular was a robust solution for big projects, VueJS was the new one just gaining terrain and React was a Component based framework which back then allowed more flexibility than the others.

The comparison I showed in my presentation was something like this one:

![Google Trends - Web Frameworks](https://github.com/adancarrasco/my-blog/blob/master/content/assets/having-and-using-a-tech-radar/google_trends_frameworks.png?raw=true)

The example worked well by the purpose it had. I wanted to show the trends on Web Development and mainly in the Front End side. However, for our day to day job we cannot rely on a Google Trends search to decide wether we want to pick a Technology over the other. What can we do then?

A few months ago a friend of mine tole me about a [Website](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar) where you could see the behavior on adoption for new technologies. Cool thing is this is not only focused in Web Frameworks, this covers a wide variety of topics regarding Software Development. Covering Languages and Frameworks, Techniques, Tools and Platforms. Really well covered! So, how do I use it to prevent it becomes just a better presentation of Google Trends?

# Using Tech Radar:

The Tech Radar from [Thought Works](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar) can be used to give you an idea on how the things are moving in their radar (in general). This is a good starting point for you to create your own radar in your company or organization. First step would be to list the technologies you currently use in the four different topics: Languages and Frameworks, Techniques, Tools and Platforms. Once you have the list, next step is to position those technologies in the corresponding level of your radar: Adopt, Trial, Asses, Hold.

## Hold

Would be the projects/usages of that technology that you currently have but you don't want new projects to use.

## Asses

Technologies that sounds like a good idea to consider, those represent some risk and you wouldn't want to use them for real projects.

## Trial

These are the ones where you consider are strong enough to be worked in internal projects, to evaluate them so your team can start learning about them, less risk.

# Adopt

Technologies that you feel strong about, these can be the used for new projects and your team should be really focused on.

Depending on how fast your organization evolves, you could set a re-evaluation date for your Tech Radar. This can be every Quarter, every six months. Since technology is constantly changing I wouldn't recommend to evaluate your radar less than 2 times a year.

The tech radar will give you enough clarity on how your organization uses technologies and give you a better panorama when taking decisions about which techs to adopt and which to stop using. Hopefully you don't end-up using old techs that nobody uses making your project hard to develop and maintain.

While doing this post I found material that might help you and used as reference:
